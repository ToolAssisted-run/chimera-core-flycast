# The core-level equivalence gate: the sandboxed core must produce
# byte-identical video, audio, lag and memory-domain digests to the native
# reference build (the same sources compiled natively), and must survive a
# whole-machine savestate round-trip around every frame.
#
# M1 SCOPE. The machine runs; it does not yet draw (Flycast has no software
# renderer - see docs/PLAN.md), and it runs this repository's own SH4 program
# rather than a game, because a Dreamcast game is somebody's copyrighted disc.
# So what this proves today is the thing everything else rests on: 200 million
# SH4 instructions, the AICA, the timers and the memory system, identical
# inside the sandbox and out.
#
# Usage: ./run-gate.sh [-n <native build dir>] [-g <guest build dir>]
